# DICOM 3D Texture Slicing Visualization

This project visualizes CT DICOM medical images by rendering orthogonal slices of a 3D texture. Using **Three.js** and `Data3DTexture`, it enables interactive exploration of scans along the X, Y, and Z axes.

This is just demonstration, how can DICOM series data can be processed visualized. It's NOT supporting all `.dcm` files, and only working with example.

## Features

- **DICOM Data**: Converts medical scans into a 3D texture for visualization.
- **Interactive Slicing**: Adjust slice indices along any axis in real-time.
- **Texture Slicing**: Uses GLSL shaders to dynamically render slices.
